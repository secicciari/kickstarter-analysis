# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to observe how campaign launch dates and funding goals relate to the final campaign outcomes.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Below is a visualization of the number of successful, failed, and canceled theater campgaigns based on the campaign launch date.

I conducted this analysis by determining the month that each Theater campaign was launched, and then determining how many campaigns were successful, failed, or canceled during each month.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Below is a visualization of the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled campgaigns for plays based on the goal fundraising amount.

I conducted this analysis by breaking out the campaign goal amounts into buckets and determining how many campaigns were successful, failed, or canceled within each of those buckets. Then, I calculated the percentage of campaigns that were successful, failed, and canceled within each bucket.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I did not encounter any difficulties in completing this analysis, but one challenge I could foresee would be determining which buckets to break the goal amounts into for the Outcomes Based on Goals analysis. If there is a high number of projects that fall into the smallest or largest bucket, this could skew the data and require additional analysis to unpack.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  - The two months with the highest number of successful Theater campaigns launched are May and June. December is the least popular month for launching Theater campaigns, and just under half of the campaigns that are launched in December failed.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  - Campaigns with goals greater than or equal to $45,000 have a high likelihood of failing. Also, most Theater campaigns set a goal between $1,000 and $4,999.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  - This dataset only includes projects that utilized Kickstarter to raise funds, and only reflects funds that were contributed through Kickstarter. There are many other crowdfunding tools, and it's possible that a category may be more or less successful with Kickstarter than another tool.
  - Another limitation of this dataset is that it only includes Kickstarter projects through 2017. The online fundraising landscape continues to grow and change with new technology, so this information from 2017 may already be outdated and not very applicable to a project that is set to launch in 2020 or 2021.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  - It would be interesting to look at the average donation and number of backers by country and subcategory. This analysis can help inform how widely a fundraiser needs to cast a net for backers, depending on which market they are operating in.
  - We can also look at outcomes based on campaign length in order to recommend an optimal campaign deadline based on a campaign's goals.
