## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The highest number of successful campaigns are launched in May and June.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Campaigns with goals greater than or equal to $45,000 have a high likelihood of failing.


- What are some limitations of this dataset?
This dataset only includes projects that utilized Kickstarter to raise funds. There are many other crowdfunding tools

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
It would be interesting to look at the average donation and number of backers by country and subcategory. This analysis can help inform how widely Louise needs to cast a net for backers, depending on which market she is raising funds for. We can also look at outcomes based on campaign length in order to recommend an optimal campaign deadline based on Louise's goals.
